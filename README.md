Fourth module homework
Write a Python program that does the following:


Has YOUR NAME and “#4” in a comment in the header AND in the filename

Includes a function which adds new food orders to a general list of items to prepare

Includes a another function which displays all the remaining items to be prepared in the food order

Includes a third function which searches through the food order and deletes items that match a given name, leaving other items untouched  

Stretch goal: instead of functions, put all of these into external libraries.
